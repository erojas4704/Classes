                <section>
                    It is essentially an agreed upon set of standards and expectations for how web
                    browsers and web servers should communicate with eachother.

                <section>
                    URL is an acronym that stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a string
                    that is sent to a network to make a request for a resource.
                </section>
                <section>
                    It carries a protocol, a hostname or IP, a port (optionally), a directory, and potentially
                    additional
                    parameters in the form of a query string.
                </section>
                <section>
                    This information is then parsed by servers which then send back the appropriate data.

                <section>
                    DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS are servers that work to resolve domain names to their IP
                    addresses by comparing the names to their directories.

                </div>
                <section>
                    A query string is a string at the end of an URL that carries name/value pairs. This string
                    is used by web servers to determine what information they send to the browser.

                <section>
                    The two HTTP verbs are HTTP, and HTTPS. The difference is that HTTPS is encrypted.
                    HTTPS servers must have signed certificates to be trusted by browsers.

                <div class="h4">What is an HTTP request?</div>
                <section>
                    An HTTP request is a request for a server resource made through an URL. Requests can be one of
                    several
                    types,
                    mainly GET and POST. GET requests are merely for requesting data, while POST requests are more
                    likely to
                    have
                    permanent changes on the server-side.

                <div class="h4">What is an HTTP response?</div>
                <section>
                    An HTTP response is the response returned by the server after a request is made. Responses have a
                    body
                    which is what is interpreted by the web-browser to create a page.

                <div class="h4">What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have
                    seen.</div>
                <section>
                    An HTTP header is meta-data attached to requests. HTTP headers have information such as cookies,
                    language, mime-type, method,as well as many others.
                </section>
                <section>
                    This determines how the server should parse the request.
                </section>
            </article>

            <article>
                <div class="h4">What are the processes that happen when you type <span
                        class="text-primary">“http://somesite.com/some/page.html”</span> into a browser?</div>
                <section>
                    First the browser recognizes the http protocol and creates an http request for
                    "somesite.com/some/page.html".
                </section>
                <section>
                    Then, that request is routed to your ISP, which, using a Domain Name System, looks up "somesite.com"
                    and
                    finds
                    its IP address.
                </section>
                <section>
                    After, somesite.com interprets the GET request for "some/page.html" and responds with the
                    appropriate
                    data,
                    sending
                    back the page
                    as a body in the request response.
                </section>
                <section>
                    Your browser reads through the response, and line by line, requests
                    every
                    necessary resource within that page.
